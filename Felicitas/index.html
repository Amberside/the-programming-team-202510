        Still working part-time in the accounting field. Truthfully, I can close my eyes and create a 'Profit & Loss Statement'
        and 'Balance Sheet'. Accurate? Of course, not. I do need accurate records to do so. 
        From bookkeeping to payroll, I have done this kind of work. 
        But there is nothing like dealing with ATO on behalf of clients. You probably may guess, I am a tax agent.

        Sounds good to be working with laws concerning taxes. ATO wants to collect as much taxes within the law. 
        On the other hand, taxpayers have different agenda. The dilemna is that where do tax agents stand?

        Today, here I am. Not planning of retirement. Rather, I am student. Collected too many certificates including 
        Graduate Certificate in Migration.

        In the classroom, that is where I am. Working with my assignment in JavaScript. Create my own website, that 
        is the aim. And having other dreams on its way. Too old, too old.

        Nope. Learn from teachers. Learn from fellow students. That is my way of getting older each day.
