      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Hello there, I'm Nasri Ahmed, a student at Holmesglen Institute with a
        love for creating clean and responsive websites. My projects reflect my
        growing skills in web development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Iâ€™ve
        developed several applications, including a fully functional Movie
        Manager web app that allows users to add, search, sort, and display
        movie data with a clean and responsive UI. I'm excited to continue
        learning and building more creative and useful applications as I grow in
        the tech industry.
